Motivation
---
The goal of this repository is to provide a ~~state of the art~~ model implementation, that leverages the power of MVC architecture. The implementation will be inspired by [A Better MVC](https://davedelong.com/blog/2017/11/06/a-better-mvc-part-1-the-problems/) posts and publicly available Apple documentation.
